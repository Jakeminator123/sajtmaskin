# Comment unclear code parts

Comment parts of the code that are not documented or are hard to understand.

- Be short and precise.
- If you are confused, **do not hallucinate**.
  - Instead, write: `// TODO: This part needs further investigation`
- If you later understand what a `// TODO: This part needs further investigation` actually does,
  and you are confident, rewrite it to a clear explanation of the real behavior.
