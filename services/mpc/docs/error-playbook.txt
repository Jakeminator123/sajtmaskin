Error reporting playbook

Goal: capture enough context so Cursor agents can reproduce and triage quickly.

Fields to send via report_error
- message (required): short summary of what went wrong.
- level: error|warn|info (default error).
- stack: stack trace if available.
- component: UI/screen or service name (e.g., "builder/chat-panel").
- user: relevant user/account id if applicable (avoid secrets).
- context: small JSON object with extra data (inputs, feature flags, correlation ids).

Examples
- message: "Audit PDF rendering failed"
  level: error
  stack: <stacktrace>
  component: "audit/pdf-report"
  context: {"projectId":"abc123","template":"light"}

Operational tips
- Keep messages concise; include one issue per call.
- Prefer structured context over long free-text notes.
- Sensitive data should be masked before logging.
- Use list_errors to verify what was captured.
