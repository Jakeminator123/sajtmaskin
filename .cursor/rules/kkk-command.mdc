# kkk prefix behavior

Read .cursor/mijo.txt each turn.

If KKK=ON and the user message starts with "kkk" (case-insensitive):
1) Treat it as a /kill-server request.
2) Read .cursor/commands/kill-server.md and follow the steps.
3) After completion, handle any remaining text (after the prefix) as the normal prompt.
