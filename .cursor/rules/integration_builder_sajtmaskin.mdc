## Documentation lookup rule

- I have many docs connected via an MCP server.
- The MCP server is named: **sajtmaskin-mpc**.

## Where to find the docs

- In the root folder, there is a folder: `Services`
- Inside `Services`, there is a folder: `mpc`
- Documentation lives in `Services/mpc/docs`
- MCP server entrypoint: `Services/mpc/server.mjs`

## When to use these docs

- If you are unsure about anything related to this part of my website, consult these docs first, especially for:
  - User-facing page building / site generation
  - API integrations
 - shadcn/ui
  - SDK 6
  - Platform API
  - Model API
  - AI SDK
  - v0 SDK
  - SDK usage
  - General integrations and implementation details
