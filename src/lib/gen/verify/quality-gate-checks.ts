/**
 * Verify-lane check lists, ordered by strictness.
 *
 * Two canonical lanes (manifest `qualityGateTiers`):
 *
 *  1. **Design preview lane** (`DESIGN_PREVIEW_QUALITY_GATE_CHECKS`):
 *     Runs on preview-host right after F2 generation via the client's
 *     `runTier2VerifyLane` in `post-checks.ts`. Also used by background
 *     `triggerServerVerification` after finalize. Since 2026-04-23:
 *     `typecheck` only in F2 (`designPreview`). `build` is reserved for
 *     F3 (`integrationsBuild`) where integrations must pass full build/lint.
 *
 *  2. **Integrations build lane** (`INTEGRATIONS_BUILD_QUALITY_GATE_CHECKS`):
 *     Used for F3 ("bygg integrationer") and deploy-promotion paths.
 *     `typecheck + build` (always — F3 always pays for the build).
 *
 * Older 4-lane shape (`tier2`/`serverVerify`/`promotion`/`interactive`)
 * was collapsed 2026-04: serverVerify and interactive were duplicates of
 * the two canonical lanes with only stylistic differences.
