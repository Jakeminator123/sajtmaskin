description: Use MCP docs (Sitemaskin Docs V2) for site features, APIs, SDKs, and integrations
alwaysApply: true

## Documentation lookup rule

- I have many docs connected via an MCP server.
- The MCP server is named: **Sitemaskin Docs V2**.

## Where to find the docs

- In the root folder, there is a folder: `Services`
- Inside `Services`, there is a folder: `MPC` *(typo — should be `MCP`)*
- Inside `Services/MPC`, there are documents alongside the server **MGS**.

## When to use these docs

- If you are unsure about anything related to this part of my website, consult these docs first, especially for:
  - User-facing page building / site generation
  - API integrations
  - SDK usage
  - General integrations and implementation details
